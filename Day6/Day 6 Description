  // Day 6 of 100 days of code challenge. Progressing in the operations related to strings.
  => TOPIC : String
    QUESTION : Java Anagrams
    Two strings, a and b, are called anagrams if they contain all the same characters in the same frequencies. For this challenge, the test is not case-sensitive.
    For example, the anagrams of CAT are CAT, ACT

 => TEST CASES:

    CASE 1:
    Input: 
    anagram
    margana
    Output:
    Anagram
    Explanation : The two strings contain all the same letters in the same frequencies, so we print "Anagram".

    CASE 2: what if the two strings have different frequencies of letters.
    Input:
    anagramm
    marganaa
    Output:
    Not Anagrams
    Explanation : The two strings does not contain all the same letters in the same frequencies, we we print "Not Anagram"

  => Constraints:
     1<=length(a),length(b)<=50
     Strings a and b consist of English alphabetic characters.
     The comparison should NOT be case sensitive.
 
  =>LOGIC:
     We take the two strings and check the frequencies of the letters in the two strings and compare it. 
     The idea is based in an assumption that the set of possible characters in both strings is small. 
     that the characters are stored using 8 bit and there can be 256 possible characters. 
     So count the frequency of the characters and if the frequency of characters in both strings are the same, they are anagram of each other.
