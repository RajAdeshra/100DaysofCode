### TOPIC:
Preorder to BST
### QUESTION: 
Given an array arr[] of N nodes representing preorder traversal of some BST. You have to build the exact BST from it's given preorder traversal. In Pre-Order traversal, the root node is visited before the left child and right child nodes.

Example 1:

Input: N = 5 arr[] = {40,30,35,80,100} Output: 35 30 100 80 40 Explanation: PreOrder: 40 30 35 80 100 Therefore, the BST will be: 40 /
30 80 \ \
35 100 Hence, the postOrder traversal will be: 35 30 100 80 40
