DAY 1 README

 TASK:
 This java program is based on if-else conditional loop which is the basic building blocks of java programming. 
In this Java challenge I had to check whether the user inputted integer is odd or even and print weird or not weird on the basis of the integer.
SAMPLE INPUT: 
45
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
weird
TEST CASES:
CASE 1:
INPUT: 
56
OUTPUT:
Not weird
CASE 2:
INPUT:
raj
OUTPUT:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
~ no response on stdout ~
LOGIC:
The problem is quite simple. We use for loop to check where the number is 2 to 5
if yes, then we print not weird 
then we check if number is between 5 to 20, then we print weird
and if the number is greater than 20, then we print weird.
