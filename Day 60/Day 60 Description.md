Day 60 of my 100 days of Code
Problem: A pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. 
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. 

Example 1:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Testcase:
Accepted
Input
pattern =
"abba"
s =
"dog cat cat dog"
Output
true
Expected
true

Explanation:
We have all come across word patterns like “ABBA”, “AABB” and so on. We always wonder what this babble could relate to. Today we will try to solve a problem where we try to make use of the babble. 
A plethora of string problems does not help the case. Given a pattern and a sentence we have to look if the sentence follows the pattern/matches the pattern or not.
