In the day 2 of my 100 days of code challenge, I have decided to move ahead with the pace of learning java language but solving a problem on loops.
Loops are fundamental when it comes to Java programming and that is why I have taken a program on loops.
TASK: In this problem, we take a user inputted integer and print its first 10 multiples. (1<=i<=10) where i is the multiples of N(input)
INPUT : N (user inputted integer)
OUTPUT : First 10 multiples of N
Constraints : N has to be in range of number 2 to 20
SAMPLE INPUT : 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT :
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
4 x 3 = 12
4 x 4 = 16
4 x 5 = 20
4 x 6 = 24
4 x 7 = 28
4 x 8 = 32
4 x 9 = 36
4 x 10 = 40
TEST CASES :
CASE 1:
INPUT: 18
OUTPUT: 
18 x 1 = 18
18 x 2 = 36
18 x 3 = 54
18 x 4 = 72
18 x 5 = 90
18 x 6 = 108
18 x 7 = 126
18 x 8 = 144
18 x 9 = 162
18 x 10 = 180
CASE 2 :
INPUT : 21
OUTPUT: ~ no response on stdout ~
Reason for no Output is the constraint imposed in the code which does not allow integer value above 20
CASE 3:
INPUT: Hello
OUTPUT: Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
Reason for exception is that only integer value is accepted.
LOGIC:
The logic to print first 10 multiples of N is to initiate a loop using i variable that goes to 10 and increments every step while multiplying it with N that 
gives the multiple of the integer N.
