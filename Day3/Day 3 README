I have done a strings problem for my day 3 challenge.
TASK: Two strings are to be to inputted and we have to perform operations on it like:
1) add the length of the two strings and print them
2) check if String A is lexicographically larger than B
3) To capitalize the first letters of both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
SAMPLE INPUT:
hello
java
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
9
No
Hello Java
TEST CASES:
CASE 1:
INPUT:
raj 
adeshra
OUTPUT:
10
Yes
Raj Adeshra

CASE 2:
INPUT:
kolkata
damn
OUTPUT:
11
Yes
Kolkata Damn

CASE 3:
INPUT:
45
OUTPUT:
~ no response on stdout ~
LOGIC:
For the first operation we add the two strings and print them. For the second operation, we compare the two strings and find the bigger one, if A is bigger then B we print "No"
while if A is smaller than B then we print "Yes"
for the last operation we Capitalize the first letter of both the letters and concatenate them and adding spaces bitween them.
