 I am in my day 5 of my 100 days of code challenge and I took the program of Java Substring.
 TASK: 
 Given a string,s , and two indices, start and end, print a substring consisting of all characters in the inclusive range from start to end.
 INPUT FORMAT:
 The first line contains a single string denoting .
 The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting s, the respective values of start and end.
 OUTPUT FORMAT:
 Print the substring in the inclusive range from start to end-1.
 SAMPLE INPUT:
 madame
 2 4
 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 dam
 Now we will try some test cases for the following:
 TEST CASES:
 CASE 1:
 INPUT:
 rajadeshra
 2 6 
 OUTPUT:
 jade
 CASE 2:
 INPUT:
 howyoudoing
 OUTPUT:
 Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException
 This error came due to the fact that we have not inputted the start and end of the substring to be extracted
 from the string.
 LOGIC:
 1: Given string, we input the start and end range of the string.
 2: After that, we use the substring method to extract the string from start to end range.
 3: print the extracted substring.
