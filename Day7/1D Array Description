// Day 7 of 100 days of code challenge 
 I have completed few string based problems in these past few days and now I have taken up Arrays 
 to progress in the 100 days of code challenge. I will start this arrays concept from a
 very problem and in the coming days, I will pick up harder problems to solve.
 
 =>TOPIC:  1D Arrays
 Question: To input the size of the array(n) and n number of integers in it. Locked code in it will print 
 the elements in the array.
 
 => TEST CASES:
    CASE 1: We will normally input the size and then the elements in it.
    INPUT:
    4
    10
    20
    30
    40
    OUTPUT:
    10
    20
    30
    40
    
    CASE 2: If we do not input the size of the array
    INPUT:
    10 
    20
    30
    40
    OUTPUT:
    Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException
	  at java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:907)
    Explanation : As we have not inputted the size the compiler throws an exception for the following.
    
  =>LOGIC 
    Input the size of the array and implement for loop that runs from zero to n number of times.
    When we save each integer to its corresponding index in a, we get a=[10,20,30,40]. 
    The locked code prints each array element on a new line from left to right.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    CODE:
    import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	   
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){
          int val = scan.nextInt();
            a[i] = val;
        }

        scan.close();

        // Prints each sequential element in array a
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}
