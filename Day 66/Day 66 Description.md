Climbing Stairs
### Problem: 
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. 
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

### Testcase:
Accepted
Input
n =
3
Output
3
Expected
3

### Explanation:
If n == 0 , then the number of ways should be zero . 
if n == 1 , then there is only one way to climb the stair. if n == 2 , then there are two ways to climb the stairs. 
One solution is one step by another; the other one is two steps at one time.
