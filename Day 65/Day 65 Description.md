### Problem: 
Two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. 
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

### Testcase:
Accepted
Input
s =
"rat"
t =
"car"
Output
false
Expected
false

### Explanation:
Two strings are said to be anagrams if they make a meaningful word by rearranging or shuffling the letters of the string. 
In other words, we can say that two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters but in a different order.
