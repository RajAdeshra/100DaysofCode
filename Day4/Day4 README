I am in my day 4 of 100 days of code challenge and I did a string reversal problem today.
TASK: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.
Given a string A, print Yes if it is palindrome and No if it is not.
SAMPLE INPUT:
madam
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Yes
TEST CASES:
CASE 1:
INPUT:
raj
OUTPUT:
No
CASE 2:
INPUT:
45
OUTPUT:
No
CASE 3:
INPUT:
level
OUTPUT:
Yes
LOGIC:
we take a word and reverse it using for loop by taking the last letter of the word decrement it and reverse it. we then compare that string to the original string 
and we print "Yes" if it is same and no if it is not.
